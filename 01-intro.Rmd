# Introduction to R and RStudio 

R is a widely used programming language for data analysis and data science. Its open-source and free nature makes it accessible to everyone, and its active community offers invaluable support to its users.


## Presentation

R is a popular programming language and free open source software for data analysis and science. It is particularly powerful when performing complex statistical calculations and creating attractive graphics. R offers around 20,000 packages and is compatible with a variety of operating systems.\

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) specifically designed to work with the R programming language. It makes working with R easier and more enjoyable. 

RStudio's key features are numerous, and here are just a few of them: \

* User-friendly interface: RStudio has an intuitive interface with a code editor, console, environment panel and plot panel. This makes it easy to navigate and visualise your work.
* Code editing features: RStudio offers code editing features such as code completion, syntax highlighting and debugging, allowing you to write R code faster and easier.
* Package management: RStudio makes it easy to install and manage the many packages available for R that extend its functionality to specific tasks.
* Data visualization: RStudio makes it easy to create graphs and visualizations of your data, helping you explore trends and communicate your results.
* The ability to create projects to organise and share your work with colleagues more effectively.
* History and environment: RStudio keeps a history of your orders and variables, so you can keep track of your work and easily re-use previous elements.

### When was R created? {-}

R was created in the early 1990s by University of Auckland statisticians Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman. \
Ihaka and Gentleman, both then statistics professors at the New Zealand university, saw what Ihaka called a “common need for a better software environment” in their computer science laboratories. This realization prompted the pair to begin developing R, an implementation of the earlier S programming language. \
Although the professors started working on R in the early 90s, version 1.0.0 wasn’t officially released until February 2000. 

### Why the name R ? {-}
The R language takes its name from two sources: firstly, the first letter of the name of its creators, and secondly, a play on words with the name of its predecessor, the S language, originally designed by Bell Telephone Laboratories.

### Strengths of R {-}

* free software: has the advantage of being free and encouraging reproducible research;
* interpreted language: language closer to our language than to machine language, so simpler and more direct than, for example, C or C++;
* easier code sharing and re-use thanks to the package system and CRAN;
* an active community of developers and users:
  + R evolves quickly, and its bugs are quickly identified and corrected;
  + There is a lot of information about programming in R on the Internet;
  + The number of R packages is always growing, so new features are frequently added to R.

### Weaknesses of r {-}


## Installation of R
To install under Windows, go to this <http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/>  and follow the first link to
download the installer. Once the installer has been launched, simply install R with the default options.

## Installation of RStudio
Once R has been correctly installed, go to <http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/> to download the latest stable version of RStudio. Specifically, this is the Open Source edition of RStudio Desktop (there is also a server version).
Choose the installer for your operating system and follow the instructions in the installation program.
If you want to try out the latest RStudio features, you can download the development version (which is more feature-rich than the stable version, but may contain bugs) from 
<http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/>.
