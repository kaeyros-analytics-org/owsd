reigns supreme as a tool for transforming raw data into actionable insights. \\nData cleaning, a core competency of R, empowers us to clean, filter, transform, and aggregate data, paving the way for meaningful analysis. This introductory paragraph delves into the world of data manipulation and data cleaning in R, highlighting its significance and exploring the key concepts involved.\\n\\nThere are several methods used for data cleansing, including:\\n\\n## Renaming colums\\n\\nDuring data cleansing, column renaming plays a crucial role in organizing and clarifying the dataset. This step involves assigning meaningful and consistent names to columns, which facilitates their interpretation and subsequent use in analysis.\\n\\n\\n```r\\n#load the package\\nlibrary(dplyr)\\n\\n#rename the variable \\\"Are you married?\\\"\\ndata_1 %>%\\n  dplyr::rename(marital_status=`Are you married?`)\\n```\\n\\n\\n## Handling Missing Data: \\n\\nMissing data, also known as missing values, is a common challenge encountered in data analysis. It refers to the absence of information for specific variables in certain observations within your dataset. To deal with missing data we have two options: impute data or remove data.\\n\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1) Imputation\\n\\nwe can use imputation by mean, median or mode.\\n\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- *Imputation by mean*:\\n\\n\\n```r\\n#Create a new column of number of varieties\\ndata_1$number_variety <- str_sub(data_1$`How many varieties do you grow on the same plot or in the same field?`, 1, 1)\\n\\n#verify the type of the column\\nstr(data_1$number_variety)\\n\\n#transform the type into number\\ndata_1$number_variety <- as.integer(data_1$number_variety)\\n\\n#impute NA values by mean\\ndata_1$number_variety[is.na(data_1$number_variety)]<-round(mean(data_1$number_variety, na.rm = TRUE))\\n```\\n\\n\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- *Imputation by median*:\\n\\n\\n```r\\nlibrary(stringr)\\n#function to extract the number of kg in the column\\ndata_1$`What is the production in kg or ton/year?` <- sapply(data_1$`What is the production in kg or ton/year?`, function(x) {\\n    # Extract digits using regular expression and convert to numeric\\n    str_extract(x, \\\"\\\\\\\\d+\\\") %>% as.numeric()\\n})\\n\\n#impute the column by median\\ndata_1$`What is the production in kg or ton/year?`[is.na(data_1$`What is the production in kg or ton/year?`)]<-median(data_1$`What is the production in kg or ton/year?`, na.rm = TRUE)\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- *Imputation by mode*:\\n\\n\\n```r\\ndata_1$`Where do you get your seeds?`[is.na(data_1$`Where do you get your seeds?`)] <- names(which.max(table(data_1$`Where do you get your seeds?`)))\\n```\\n\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2) Removing data\\n\\nThere are 2 usuals methods for deleting data when dealing with missing data: listwise and dropping variables.\\n\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- *Listwise*:\\n\\nIn this method, all data for an observation that has one or more missing values are deleted. The analysis is run only on observations that have a complete set of data. \\n\\n\\n```r\\nna.omit(data_1)\\n```\\n\\n\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- *Dropping variables*:\\n\\nIf data is missing for a large proportion of the observations, it may be best to discard the variable entirely if it is insignificant.\\n\\n\\n```r\\nsubset( data_1, select = -c(`How do you call these varieties you have?`))\\n```\\n\\n## Handling outliers\\n\\nData points far from the dataset’s other points are considered outliers. The presence of outliers can pose significant problems in statistical analysis and machine learning. They can bias model parameter estimates, lead to erroneous conclusions and affect algorithm performance.\\n\\n\\n```r\\noutlier_values <- boxplot.stats(data_1$`How many children do you have?`)$out  # outlier values.\\nboxplot(data_1$`How many children do you have?`, main=\\\"Number of children\\\", boxwex=0.1)\\nmtext(paste(\\\"Outliers: \\\", paste(outlier_values, collapse=\\\", \\\")), cex=0.6)\\n```\\n\\nAfter identify outliers you can handle it by either impute those outliers by a value (mean, median, mode) or use the method of capping (For missing values that lie outside the **1.5 * IQR** limits, we could cap it by replacing those observations outside the lower limit with the value of 5th percentile and those that lie above the upper limit, with the value of 95th percentile)\\n\\n## Removing duplicates: \\\\\\nRemoving duplicates ensures that each data point is represented only once, leading to more accurate and consistent data for analysis.\\n\\n\\n```r\\ndata_1 <- data_1 %>% \\n  dplyr::distinct()\\n```\\n\\n## Checking data structure: \\n\\nChecking data types is a crucial step in data analysis because it ensures you're working with the data in the way it's intended in order to avoid errors later in the analysis.\\n\\n\\n```r\\nstr(data_1)\\n```\\n\\nYou can change the type of your data across many functions like: as.numeric(), as.character(), as.factor() etc....if the data is not in the right type.\\n\\n## Handling Inconsistent Categorical Data\\n\\nCategorical variables may have inconsistent spellings or categories. The recode() function or manual recoding can help standardize categories.\\n\\n\\n```r\\ndata_1 <- data_1 %>%\\n  dplyr::mutate(`How do you store your seed?` = dplyr::recode(`How do you store your seed?`, \\\"In bags\\\" = \\\"in bags\\\"))\\n```\\n\\n\\n## Combine dataframes\\n\\nSuppose the dataset combines data from different sources, we can combine differents datasets into one. When combining data from multiple sources, ensure that all data fields align correctly.\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Combine by column\\n\\n\\n```r\\nculture1 <- data.frame(\\n  Culture = c(\\\"wheat\\\", \\\"maize\\\", \\\"rice\\\"),\\n  Area = c(100, 150, 120)\\n)\\n\\nculture2 <- data.frame(\\n  Culture = c(\\\"wheat\\\", \\\"maize\\\", \\\"rice\\\"),\\n  Return = c(50, 60, 45)\\n)\\n\\nculture_final1 <- cbind(culture1, culture2)\\n```\\n\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- combine by row\\n\\n\\n```r\\nculture3 <- data.frame(\\n  Culture = c(\\\"wheat\\\", \\\"maize\\\", \\\"rice\\\"),\\n  Area = c(100, 150, 120)\\n)\\n\\nculture4 <- data.frame(\\n  Culture = c(\\\"potato\\\", \\\"cassava\\\"),\\n  Area = c(250, 400)\\n)\\n\\nculture_final2 <- rbind(culture3, culture4)\\n```\\n\\n## Data Validation\\n\\nData validation involves checking data against predefined rules or criteria. It ensures that data adheres to specific requirements or constraints.\\n\\nValidation checks can prevent incorrect or inconsistent data from entering your analysis.\\n\\n## Regular expressions\\n\\nRegular expressions (regex) are powerful tools for pattern matching and replacement in text data. The gsub() function is commonly used for global pattern substitution.\\n\\n\\n```r\\ndata_1$`How much does 1kg of tasba seed cost?` <- gsub(\\\"FCFA\\\", \\\"\\\", \\n                        data_1$`How much does 1kg of tasba seed cost?`)\\n```\\n\\n\\n\"\nsource(\"./dependencies.R\")"},{"path":"descriptive-statistics.html","id":"descriptive-statistics","chapter":"7 Descriptive statistics","heading":"7 Descriptive statistics","text":"","code":""},{"path":"descriptive-statistics.html","id":"central-tendency-indicators","chapter":"7 Descriptive statistics","heading":"7.1 Central Tendency Indicators","text":"Central tendency indicators, also known measures central tendency, statistical measures used summarize set data finding single value represents middle center data. basically give idea data points tend cluster around.three main types central tendency indicators:Mean\ncommon one, also called average. ’s calculated adding values data set dividing number values.Median\nmiddle number arrange data set order, least greatest. even number data points, median average two middle numbers.Mode\nfrequent value data set. can multiple modes, way, couple values tie frequent.","code":"\nmean(data_1$`What is the production in kg or ton/year?`)\n#> [1] 138.3084\nmedian(data_1$`What is the production in kg or ton/year?`)\n#> [1] 8\nnames(which.max(table(data_1$`Are you married?`)))\n#> [1] \"YES\""},{"path":"descriptive-statistics.html","id":"variability-indicators","chapter":"7 Descriptive statistics","heading":"7.2 Variability indicators","text":"Variability indicators, contrast central tendency, tell spread data . describe much data points differ central value (mean, median, mode). common ways measure variability:Variance\naverage squared deviations data point mean. tells much data varies average, since uses squared values, can sensitive extreme values.Standard deviation\nsquare root variance.
